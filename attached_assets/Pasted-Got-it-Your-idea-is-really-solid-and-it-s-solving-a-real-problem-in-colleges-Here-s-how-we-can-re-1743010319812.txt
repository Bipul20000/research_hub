Got it! Your idea is really solid, and it's solving a real problem in colleges. Here's how we can refine it while keeping it simple and effective:
Core Features (Keeping it Practical)
Research Directory
Professors' Database: Names, departments, research areas, ongoing projects.
Students' Database: Research interests, skills, availability for collaboration.
Search & Filter: Students and professors can search based on research fields, keywords, and availability.
Matchmaking System (No ML, just rule-based)
Interest Matching: If a student’s research interests align with a professor’s field, they get suggested as potential collaborators.
Experience Level Filter: Students can be categorized (beginner, intermediate, advanced) based on past projects, helping professors find the right students.
One-click Connect: A “Request Collaboration” button to send a connection request with a short message.
Community Forum
Discussion threads for research-related queries, collaboration requests, and guidance.
Upvote/downvote system to highlight relevant discussions.
Categories: General Research, Funding Opportunities, Publication Help, Research Groups.
College Research Highlights (Admin-Managed)
A dedicated section showing the latest research done in college.
Admin uploads brief summaries of papers/projects with contributor names.
Featured projects section for major achievements.
How to Build It (Step-by-Step)
1. Database Schema (MySQL)
You'll need:
users (id, name, role, email, department, research_interests, bio, profile_pic)
projects (id, title, description, owner_id, status, created_at)
collaborations (id, professor_id, student_id, status, request_date)
forum_posts (id, title, content, author_id, category, created_at)
research_updates (id, title, summary, contributors, posted_by, date_posted)
2. Streamlit Web App Structure
Homepage: Intro to the platform + research highlights.
Profiles: Professors & students can edit their research interests.
Search Page: Find professors/students based on research interests.
Collaboration Requests: Accept/reject invitations.
Forum Page: Community discussions.
Admin Dashboard: Upload research updates.
3. Implementing Features
Use mysql-connector-python to connect MySQL with Streamlit.
CRUD operations for user profiles, projects, and forum posts.
Implement search using SQL LIKE queries for flexible matching.
Making It Even Better (Without Complexity)
Bookmarks: Save professors/students for later reference.
Messaging System: Basic chat for collaboration discussions.
Email Notifications: Notify users when they get a request.
